## Tech Stack

At its core, this project is built on the latest iteration of the Angular framework, specifically version 16. Angular, renowned for its versatility and robust features, provides a strong foundation for the integration of interactive elements and the creation of a user experience that is both seamless and engaging.

To enhance the visual aesthetics and user experience, I opted for the utilization of SCSS (Sass), a powerful CSS preprocessor. Moreover, the implementation of Angular animations elevates the user experience by introducing fluidity and dynamism to the website.

Furthermore, this project underscores my commitment to best practices in web development by embracing static typing through TypeScript. This decision is driven by the goal of reducing the occurrence of common type-related errors, ultimately enhancing the maintainability and stability of the codebase. In doing so, I prioritize the long-term performance and functionality of this online portfolio.
